1.  WRITE A GET API TO GET THE LIST OF ALL THE "vaccination sessions by district id" for any given district id and for any given date. This is a very basic assignment and totally along the lines of what we covered in the session

  http://api.openweathermap.org => “subscribe” current weather data ==> get api key for Free version ==> create new account and Verify your emailId( Must verify to avoid issues) => go to My APi keys under your account name(top right corner) or https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys => save the key/appid somewhere. Now proceed further.
Create API's to do the following:
Get weather of London from  http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=<useYourOwnAppId>  

then change the above to get the temperature only( of London)
Sort the cities     [ "Bengaluru","Mumbai", "Delhi", "Kolkata", "Chennai", "London", "Moscow"]   in order of their increasing temperature
